## About me ðŸ’»ðŸŒˆ

Hi! I'm Ezra and I'm studying for a masters in Software Engineering at UMinho. 

I have an interest in web development and am always looking to learn more about it :)

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on my thesis project, a platform for visualizing and navigating OntoDL+ ontologies.
