## About me ðŸ’»ðŸŒˆ

Hi! I'm Ezra and I'm studying for a masters in Software Engineering at UMinho. 

I have an interest in web development (with a preference for frontend work) and I am looking to expand my skills in this field :)

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on my thesis project, a platform for visualizing and navigating OntoDL+ ontologies.

More information about this project is available here: [epl.di.uminho.pt/~gepl/pronto](https://epl.di.uminho.pt/~gepl/pronto/)

The platform itself is available here: <br/> [pronto-computationalthinking4all.epl.di.uminho.pt](https://pronto-computationalthinking4all.epl.di.uminho.pt/)
